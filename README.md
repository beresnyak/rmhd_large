# Large reduced MHD datacubes and statistics

Go to https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=cd71b5d6-8850-426a-b057-0b269b10fb82&origin_path=%2F
to download MHD turbulence datacubes up to 4096^3 for balanced turbulence and up to 3072^3 for imbalanced turbulence.

Directories with "n" indicate simulations with ordinary 2nf order viscosity and "h" indicates 4th order hyperviscosity.

Precomputed statistics of various kinds is in this repository. See "scripts" for code to plot various spectra and structure functions from precomputed statistics and "pics" for these plots.
